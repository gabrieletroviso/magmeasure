# magmeasure
Script written to measure amplification in gravitational lens

In this repository there are both script and .fits files to do several measures of magnification in simulated gravitational lensing events. The script is made using pyLensLib library (https://github.com/maxmen/pyLensLib), while file .fits of deflection angle is taken from private repository (https://github.com/maxmen). Magnification map came from international gravitational lensing community works (see: Meneghetti et al. (2017). The frontier fields lens modelling comparison project. MNRAS, 472(3):3177â€“3216).
